# Logistic-Regression-Project

This project is a 2 parts projects. 

## - The first part is the logistic regression applied to a 2D data:

In this exercise, I will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.

The goal is to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. we have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, we have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.

The objective is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams.

## - In this second part I apply the concept of regularisation to solve the overfitting problem.

In this exercise, I will implement the regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.
If I have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests, I would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected.
